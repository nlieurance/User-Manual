# Quickstart guide
Looking for a quick picture of who I am and how I might fit in with your team?

## My core strengths
I'm an outstanding writer, a good designer, and I'm a whiz with software. I think about the big picture, not just my immediate deliverables. And I've been known to boost communication and engagement. Because of that, the teams I work on get thing done.

## What I'm looking for in my next role
My next role will require a blend of writing, information architecture, and strategy skills. I'll help stakeholders build meaningful user experiences, create helpful documentation, and work better together.

## Location and work preferences
I thrive as a **remote contributor**. I've tailored a work space to my own needs and developed a rhythm that allows me to maximize productivity. In previous roles, I collaborated with teams scattered across the United States, Amsterdam, and India.
