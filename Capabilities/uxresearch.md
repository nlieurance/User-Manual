# UX research
I'm passionate about understanding and advocating for users, which is why research is so important to me. My research toolkit is robust. Check out these examples of how I've used research to make an impact.

## A/B tests 
SurveyMonkey users weren't engaging with our copy/paste feature. But we knew how much time it could save. So we launched an A/B test based on the hypothesis that clearer copy would help people find the feature. I set up a pair-writing session with a UX writing peer. We worked on the copy together. When the test was done, we had a clear winner. Our copy appears in the product today, and more people user the feature than ever. 

## Card sorting
When In-Situ was redesigning its website, there was an opportunity to reorganize the help content to improve discoverability. I conducted a card-sorting exercise with internal stakeholders and external customers to identify users' expectations. As a result, I was able to design a winning structure that's still in use.

## Cloze tests
I was part of the team responsible for automating the way SurveyMonkey integrated with third-party software, like Microsoft Teams and Salesforce. There was a lot of uncertainly around terminology. So I conducted a Cloze test via a survey. Then I organized the data into a dashboard and gave a presentation to explain the insights. We were able to pick terminology that performed well during user interviews. 

## Interviews
SurveyMonkey has been around since the late 1990s. A lot of the product's language originated with engineers or product managers and had never been tested. I put together a research plan to find the words that worked for our users. It involved an interview and a sort of role-playing exercise. I piloted the test with 10 internal stakeholders, revealing several insights and validating the methodology.

## Usability tests
Designs for Build with AI, SurveyMonkey's new feature, were ready for testing. I had worked with the product designer and product manager to create the concept. We still needed to find out if the UI copy made sense, the interactions were intuitive, and whether there were any usability issues. So I made a prototype based on the designs and used it to conduct a small  test. We found that participants understood the UI copy, completed the test with ease, and had good impressions of the product. That gave us confidence to launch. Now Build with AI is the #1 way new users create surveys.
