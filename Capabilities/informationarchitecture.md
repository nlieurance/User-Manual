# Information architecture
I work hard to organize information in ways that make sense to my audience. Starting with in-depth research, I learn how people expect things to work and then design structures to match. I consider the following elements for every document or digital product I build:

- Content stucture
- Menus and navigation
- Search
- Taxonomy
- Terminology
