# Strategy
My work is often about aligning user needs with business goals.

## Ideal customer profiles
SurveyMonkey created three ideal customer profiles so the whole company would know who our customers were and why they needed us. When I wrote content for the redesigned question editor, did language research for a major design transformation, and delivered UI copy for various projects, I did so with these profiles in mind. I used language that reflected their most common use cases. I prioritized their most-needed features when working on information architecture. My team could always connect our work to the company's top priorities.

## In-Situ documentation
When I joined In-Situ, there was no strategy around documentation. So I did some research. I talked with customers, designers, engineers, salespeople, and support reps. Their input led me to create a docs-as-products strategy that included observability. In other words, I built beautiful documentation for users across the spectrum of education and experience. Then I monitored how people interacted with our content and gathered feedback. As a result, we had what one distributor called "the best documentation of any manufacturer we work with."

## Popular Woodworking
I was responsible for building an online learning platform at Popular Woodworking. We only had two courses when I started with the company, which wouldn't take us far. I researched the competition, looked at what products were popular in our online store, and viewed analytics from our streaming platform. The data I got from those activities helped me formulate a content strategy that drove two years of audience and revenue growth.
