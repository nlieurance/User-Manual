# Cross-functional collaboration
Is there anything more important? I've worked with partners from design, engineering, product management, product marketing, sales, and support teams since 2014. Here are some examples of how we collaborated.

## SurveyMonkey question editor
SurveyMonkey users interact with the question editor whenever they add and configure survey questions. I was part of the team responsible for modernizing the feature. We didn't really have a starting point. This was one of those projects that started with a mandate from leadership. So I put together a kickoff document and shared it with the team. The lead designer scheduled a workshop, where we all got together and talked about next steps. I suggested a discovery activity, and we all went out and gathered data from existing research, as well as hundreds of responses to our in-product survey. As a result, we identified pain points and were able to start building a concept.
