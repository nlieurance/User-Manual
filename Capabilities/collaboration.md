# Cross-functional collaboration
Is there anything more important? I've worked with partners from design, engineering, product management, product marketing, sales, and support teams since 2014. Here are some examples of how we collaborated.

## SurveyMonkey question editor
SurveyMonkey users interact with the question editor whenever they add and configure survey questions. I was part of the team responsible for modernizing the feature. We didn't really have a starting point. This was one of those projects that started with a mandate from leadership. So I put together a kickoff document and shared it with the team. The lead designer scheduled a workshop, where we all got together and talked about next steps. I suggested a discovery activity, and we all went out and gathered data from existing research, as well as hundreds of responses to our in-product survey. As a result, we identified pain points and were able to start building a concept.

## Build with AI
As SurveyMonkey got closer and closer to finishing development for Build with AI, we needed to choose a feature name. I organized a cross-functional workshop with people from design, engineering, marketing, product management, and support teams. We aligned on naming criteria, brainstormed, and chose three of our favorite potential names. Then I presented those three names to 200 people in a name-test survey. I shared the winner with stakeholders—Build with AI. We all agreed to call the feature by that name. Now it’s the #1 way new users create SurveyMonkey surveys.
