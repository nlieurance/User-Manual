# Coding
I'm not a software engineer or a developer. But coding skills have helped me build some useful things in previous roles. For example, I used my PHP skills when building and launching an online knowledge base with WordPress at In-Situ. The following examples should help you understand my coding skills.

## HTML/CSS
I was in college when I first learned to use HTML and CSS. How long ago was that? None of your business! But Flash was super popular. Every website you went to had an intro page where you could choose to visit the Flash site or the static site. And I took my college’s first web design class, where we may have used Dreamweaver at some point.

## Markdown
I used Markdown to create all the content for this site. Then I pushed it to GitHub and synced the repository with GitBook. Does any of that make sense?

## PHP/MySQL
Back in 2015, I had this idea for a CRUD app that would allow homeowners to get quotes for cabinet projects without getting spammed. So I built it. From scratch. With no prior experience in PHP/MySQL, setting up a server, or using databases. I was able to include lots of important features: authentication, content creation and reading, pagination, filtering, updating, and deleting.

## Python
In 2014, I was the foreman at a cabinet shop in Colorado. To demonstrate the efficiency of a manufacturing process I wanted to use, I built a software simulation. From scratch. With Python and Tkinter. I’m not sure why I thought I’d be able to pull it off. But I did.
