# How I work

## My work style
I'm autonomous, yet collaborative. I like to think deeply about problems and try creative approaches to solving them. Frameworks and mental models are integral to my processes. Mind maps and other diagrams help me make sense of complexity. 

For me, few things are as energizing and inspiring as interactive workshops where I can collaborate with other creatives. I treasure opportunities to bounce ideas off and get inspired by others.

It's also important for me to have some focus time. That's when I get to do my deep thinking.

## Communication preferences
These are my favorite tools for keeping in touch:
- **Slack**: Team channels are great. Direct messages work well for me too.
- **Zoom**: Let's hop on a call and chat about that project.
- **Email**: I check my messages once or twice a day.

## Giving and receiving feedback
I never want to be a dictator who says things should be done this way or that way. That's why I like to deliver feedback in the form of questions. I'm also fond of showing how I might do something in order to open up a conversation about differing approaches. 

If you're giving me feedback, be respectful and try to provide concrete information. Point to something I've done and talk about something specific. Give me an example of what you'd like to see from me.
