# How do you advocate for content design?
Most of the designers I've worked with didn't have much experience collaborating with content designers when we started working together. That was true of many design partners at SurveyMonkey. In our first meetings, they'd walk me through UI copy and ask for edits. I'd request some time to explore the options. Then I'd mock up ideas that incorporated different UI components. I'd tinker with interaction design to perfect the flow of information between app and user. My design partners saw that I wasn't just there to "massage" the copy. They learned to bring me in early and invite me to share the product vision.
