# About me

## Background
I'm from Kansas City, Missouri. I lived there until 2006, when my wife and I moved to Fort Collins, CO. We wanted to be close to the mountains for camping, hiking, and fishing. 

I haven't always worked as a writer. I spent 12 years in the woodworking trade. The early mornings, long hours, dangerous conditions, and meager pay make my current career feel like a breath of fresh air. If I don't seem rattled by deadlines or pressure, that's probably why. 

## Strengths
- **Attitude**: I bring lots of smiles and a positive outlook.
- **Curiosity**: I ask "What if?" a few times a day, maybe more.
- **Empathy**: During a stint as a volunteer crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line, I learned to understand how others feel.
- **Humor**: There have been numerous studies on the connection between humor and intelligence. Basically, I'm a genius. 
- **Memory**: My ability to remember names, faces, dates, numbers, and quotes is almost scary.
- **Technology**: If there's a new piece of software or new device to learn, I'm all about it.
- **Writing**: My mom was a writer and English teacher when I was a kid. Writing is in my blood.

## Weaknesses
- **Housekeeping**: I can't seem to keep the clutter from piling up on my desk.
- **Self-promotion**: I focus on building great user experiences. I should spend more time building my career.

## Personal values
- **Autonomy, flexibility, and trust**: Nothing is more important to me than control of my own time.
- **Preparation**: I do my research and assemble resources before any interaction.
- **Recognition**: I enjoy recognizing people for their ideas, contributions, and idiosyncracies. I want to get recognition for mine.
- **Responsiveness**: I get back to people right away. To the best of my ability, I deliver requests immediately.
- **Support**: The people in my life, including the ones I work with, can count on my support.

## My next role
I enjoy building things, creating concepts, and formulating strategies. In my next role, I'll work closely with designers, engineers, and product managers. My title could be any of the following:

- Content designer 
- Knowledge manager
- Technical writer
- UX writer

## Work location
I live a bit north of Denver, so I'm on Mountain Time. Typically, I'm online an hour before folks on the West Coast.

I thrive as a **remote contributor** and have been working from home since 2020. My workspace is quiet and free of distractions. But the occasional in-person event is just fine with me. I love to socialize and get to know my coworkers.
