# How I work

## My work style
I'm autonomous, yet collaborative. I love to think deeply about problems and try creative approaches to solving them. Frameworks and mental models are integral to my processes. 

## Communication preferences
For me, few things are as energizing and inspiring as interactive workshops where I can collaborate with other creatives. I love the opportunity to bounce ideas off others and get inspired by their thoughts.

It's also important for me to have some focus time. That's where I really dive deep into a problem and get a chance to flesh out concepts.

These are my favorite tools for keeping in touch:
- Slack: Team channels are great. Directs messages work well for me too.
- Zoom: Let's hop on a call and chat about that project.
- Email: I check my messages once or twice a day.

## Giving and receiving feedback
I never want to be a dictator who says things should be done this way or that way. That's why I like to deliver feedback in the form of questions. I'm also fond of showing how I might do something in order to open up a conversation about differing approaches. 

If you're giving me feedback, be respectful and try to provide concrete information. Point to something I've done and talk about something specific. Give me an example of what you'd like to see from me.

## Values I bring
Here's what partners, peers, and managers can expect from me.

- **Autonomy**: I work well with little to no direction. You can count on me to get things done.
- **Flexibility**: Got an approach that differs from mine? Want to explore options? Sounds great!
- **Preparation**: I show up to meetings and 1:1s with ideas and questions.
- **Recognition**: I'll tell everybody about your great ideas and your wins.
- **Responsiveness**: You're going to hear back from me right away.
- **Support**: Need help with something? Want some ideas? Just need to chat? I have your back.
