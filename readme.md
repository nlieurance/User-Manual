# Welcome!
Hello, I'm Nick. I write content that helps people make sense of things. That's what this user manual is all aboutâ€”helping you understand what I do and what it means for you.

**I use language to help teams build record-breaking products. Known for my commitment to understanding and advocating for users, I lead research to uncover the words and mental models that engage and convert.**

I succeed because of these three things:
- I work hard to make things easy for others. I have a habit of over delivering.
- I'm super engaged, and I get others engaged. Humor is my favorite way to do this.
- I go all-in for my team, my projects, and my company.

If you're looking for a content designer to help you build products people love, let's connect!
