# Welcome!
Hello, I'm Nick. I write content that helps people make sense of things. That's what this user manual is all aboutâ€”helping you understand what I do and what it means for you.

**I use language to help teams build record-breaking products. People know me for my commitment to understanding and advocating for users. They know me for my humor, my passion for research, and for going above and beyond.**

Based on my track record, here's what I promise to bring to your team:
- I'll help deliver features users rave about, on time.
- I'll onboard stakeholders to your projects faster than ever.
- I'll make people feel capable, empowered, and seen. I'll make them laugh and put them at ease.
- I'll do things nobody has done before, and I'll leave a legacy. 

If you're looking for a content designer to help you build products people love, let's connect!
